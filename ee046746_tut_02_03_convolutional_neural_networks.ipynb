    "* **Regularization** places constraints on the quantity and type of information your model can store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well."

    "    * **Translation** - Move the image along the X or Y direction (or both). This forces the neural network to look everywhere.\n",
    "    * **Noise** - Over-fitting usually happens when the network tries to learn high frequency features (patterns that occur a lot) that may not be useful. Gaussian noise, which has zero mean, essentially has data points in all frequencies, effectively distorting the high frequency features. This also means that lower frequency components (usually, your intended data) are also distorted, but your neural network can learn to look past that. Adding just the right amount of noise can enhance the learning capability (e.g., add Salt and Pepper).\n",
